# topo-centralized-controller-test-consumer-producer.txt

# This topology assuming that controller is centralized controller and node name is starting from node1.
# any empty lines and lines starting with '#' symbol is ignored
# The file should contain exactly two sections: router and link, each starting with the corresponding keyword
# router section defines topology nodes and their relative positions (e.g., to use in visualizer)

router

# each line in this section represents one router and should have the following data
# node  comment     yPos    xPos
Node1   NA          1       1
Node2   NA          1       2
controller   NA          2       1
Node3   NA          2       2
Consumer   NA          3       1
Producer   NA          3       2

# Note that `node` can be any string. It is possible to access to the node by name using Names::Find, see examples.
# link section defines point-to-point links between nodes and characteristics of these links

link

# Each line should be in the following format (only first two are required, the rest can be omitted)
# srcNode   dstNode     bandwidth   metric  delay   queue
# bandwidth: link bandwidth
# metric: routing metric
# delay:  link delay
# queue:  MaxPackets for transmission queue on the link (both directions)
